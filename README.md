# MQTTWithTLS
  This is a client program with TLS+MQTT.
  I've used two open source libraries here, libemqtt and mbedtls. 
  Thanks to the authors of both open source libraries, and thanks to open source.
# Compiling
  make
  make clean
# Run
  ./MQTTCNWithTLS 
# Note 
  the certificate that the program is loading is in the project directory 
  and needs to be replaced according to the client certificate generated by you.
